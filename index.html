 <h1>Guild Navigators</h1>
 <p class="subtitle">We live in the future. Let us show you how to navigate it.</p>

 <p>AI is a firehose. The intelligence explosion isn't coming—it's here. Most people are still figuring out how to use ChatGPT while the world reshapes itself around them.</p>

 <p>We've spent years modeling the future, thinking about AI safety and capability, building systems that work. Now we help you steer through it—deconfusing the chaos, identifying what matters, and building the infrastructure to keep up.</p>

 <h2>What We Do</h2>

 <p>We act as force multipliers on your key bottlenecks. You tell us what's blocking you, we help you solve it.</p>

 <div class="services-list">
 <h3>Core Capabilities</h3>
 <div class="service-item">
 <strong>AI implementation & agentic workflows</strong> — We rapidly build prototypes and production systems. More importantly, we teach you how to build them yourself. Cursor setup, custom agents, automation that actually works.
 </div>
 <div class="service-item">
 <strong>Strategic deconfusion</strong> — When you're overwhelmed by possibility space, we help you clarify priorities. What should you focus on? What's noise? What unlocks deep alpha?
 </div>
 <div class="service-item">
 <strong>Research & analysis</strong> — We investigate questions that matter. Biohacking protocols, competitive landscape analysis, technical feasibility studies. If it requires going deep, we go deep.
 </div>
 <div class="service-item">
 <strong>Rapid prototyping</strong> — Websites, tools, workflows. We build fast to test ideas, then iterate based on reality rather than theory.
 </div>
 </div>

 <p class="meta-note">We bring an eclectic mix of approaches. Military operations planning, AI safety research, entrepreneurship, coaching, technical implementation. Whatever the problem needs.</p>

 <h2>Why Us</h2>

 <p>We have deep ties to the AI safety community and years of experience thinking about transformative AI. We're not consultants who learned about LLMs in 2023—we've been in this space, building our models of how this plays out.</p>

 <p>This matters because we can help you think clearly about what's actually happening, not just what's trending on Twitter. We understand the technology, the trajectory, and the strategic landscape.</p>

 <p>We're practitioners who work with these tools daily. Every workflow we build for you is something we'd use ourselves.</p>

 <h2>How We Work</h2>

 <p>Discovery call to understand your situation. What are you trying to do? What's blocking you? Where do you need leverage?</p>

 <p>We typically start with a focused engagement—one workflow, one research question, one bottleneck. Fast iteration, real results. If it works, we continue. If not, you've learned something and we part ways.</p>

 <div class="pricing">
 <p><strong>Investment:</strong> $100-150/hour for implementation and research. Strategy and deconfusion work is $150-200/hour.</p>
 <p>Initial consultation is free. We optimize for long-term relationships with people doing important work.</p>
